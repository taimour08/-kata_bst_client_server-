/* 
CMake is an open-source build system and build configuration tool. It is used to
manage the build process of software projects across different platforms 
and build environments. 
CMake provides a platform-independent way to specify and 
generate build files (such as Makefiles or Visual Studio project files) 
for various build systems.

With CMake, you write a CMakeLists.txt file that describes 
the project structure, source files, dependencies, and build options. 
CMake then processes this file and generates the appropriate build 
files for your target platform and build system.
